It is necessary to focus on the really significant aspects of business goals and minimize the amount of mechanical work in such case. Enterprise applications are becoming more and more complex and more integrated into one another forming entire ecosystems in nowadays. In such a case the testing takes the first place in developing. There are a large number of testing methods and great tools such as JUnit,TestNG and etc. But generating of test data can be significant.

Test data generation can reach considerable effort of mechanical work which can be boring and difficult to maintain.

## Implementation
GenThz Project is tool that will perform this tedious work for you. This is a library for testing data generation. Now test data generation for JVM based languages are released.

## Advantages
Declaratively manage the creation of objects;
Ability to reuse existing configurations;
Simple usage.
## Also
You can help our project!

Most all kinds of contribution are welcomed. Feature requests, bug reports, test cases, benchmarks - all are welcomed.
